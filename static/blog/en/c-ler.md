## EWC Codes: What They Are, Their History and Stakeholder Impact

Waste management across the European Union is based on a harmonised classification known as the **EWC – European Waste Catalogue**.  
**EWC codes** are six-digit numbers assigned to each type of waste to ensure proper identification, registration, transport and treatment.

## History and European context

The EWC was established under **Commission Decision 2000/532/EC**, consolidating previous lists into a single system for all Member States.  
The aim was to eliminate fragmentation, where each country had its own classifications, making cross-border control and statistics difficult.  

Since then, the list has been updated regularly to cover new waste streams, industrial processes, and stricter definitions of hazardous waste.

## What are EWC Codes?

Each waste stream is given a **six-digit code** indicating:

- The **origin** of the waste (activity or process).  
- The **material type** (plastic, metal, paper, sludge, solvents, etc.).  
- Whether the waste is considered **hazardous** (marked with an asterisk *).  

Examples:  
- **20 01 01** → Paper and cardboard from separate collection.  
- **17 05 03\*** → Soil and stones containing hazardous substances.  

## Impact on stakeholders

### Companies (SMEs and large industries)  
- Must register all generated waste using the correct EWC codes.  
- Report through national systems (e.g., electronic registers, transport permits).  
- Required for environmental audits and ISO certifications.  

### Municipalities and public entities  
- Use EWC codes to classify municipal, organic, mixed and hazardous waste.  
- Provide the basis for recycling targets and reporting to national agencies and the EU.  

### Waste operators  
- Can only accept, transport and process waste accompanied by the correct EWC code.  
- Without the code, the operation cannot be legally documented.  

### Citizens  
- Indirectly benefit from transparency and traceability.  
- Household waste separated at source (paper, bio, glass, etc.) is classified using EWC codes.  

## Structure of the European Waste Catalogue

The catalogue is divided into **chapters** (first two digits) according to the origin of the waste.  
Within each chapter there are subcategories and finally the **six-digit code**.  

### Example chapters:
- **Chapter 15**: Packaging waste.  
- **Chapter 17**: Construction and demolition waste.  
- **Chapter 19**: Waste from treatment facilities.  
- **Chapter 20**: Municipal waste.  

## Practical examples of EWC Codes

| Code | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 15 01 01 | Paper and cardboard packaging | Recyclable, separate collection |
| 15 01 02 | Plastic packaging | Recyclable, separate collection |
| 16 01 04 | End-of-life tyres | Must go to authorised operators |
| 17 01 07 | Mixed concrete, bricks, tiles and ceramics | Non-hazardous |
| 17 05 03* | Soil and stones containing hazardous substances | Hazardous |
| 19 08 05 | Sludge from municipal wastewater treatment | Subject to strict regulation |
| 20 01 01 | Paper and cardboard | From separate collection |
| 20 01 08 | Biodegradable kitchen and canteen waste | Food waste |
| 20 01 21* | Fluorescent tubes and mercury-containing waste | Hazardous |
| 20 03 01 | Mixed municipal waste | Residual household waste |

\* The asterisk indicates **hazardous waste**.  

## Why EWC Codes matter

- Ensure legal compliance and avoid fines.  
- Enable traceability from waste producer to treatment facility.  
- Support circular economy monitoring by quantifying material flows.  
- Required in public tenders and environmental certifications.
