> **Why is registration required to access some features?**
>
> To protect all users and ensure a safe environment, P7CO® EcoResupply requires a simple registration — via email, Google, or other quick and easy methods.
> This prevents automated abuse, reduces spam, and ensures that each participation (such as reporting, surplus publishing, or contact) is made by a real person, validating identity without compromising privacy.
> Registration is free and transparent: we never share data with third parties without consent.

The trust of our users is the foundation of **P7CO® EcoResupply**. We operate with high standards of **security, transparency, and accountability**, with management and development handled by **pH7x Systems®** ([ph7x.com](https://ph7x.com)), a legally registered entity specializing in digital solutions for sustainability.
