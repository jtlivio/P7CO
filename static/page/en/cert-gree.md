## ISO Certifications and Reports

The **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** defines globally recognized standards for quality, environment, safety and social responsibility. They provide a common framework that helps organizations demonstrate best practices, ensure compliance and build trust with clients, partners and authorities.

P7CO® EcoResupply recognizes the importance of these standards and is preparing new features to support companies and municipalities in managing their ISO certifications and reports. Soon, tools for data collection, report generation and digital audit integration will be available.

### What are ISO certifications

ISO certifications are official attestations issued by accredited bodies that confirm an organization meets the requirements of a given standard. The most relevant include:

- **ISO 9001 — Quality Management**  
- **ISO 14001 — Environmental Management**  
- **ISO 45001 — Occupational Health and Safety**  
- **ISO 50001 — Energy Management**  
- **ISO 26000 — Social Responsibility**

These standards promote structured practices, improve internal processes and strengthen credibility with both national and international stakeholders.

### What are ISO reports

ISO reports are documents companies produce to demonstrate compliance with the standards. They include policies, procedures, indicators and monitoring evidence. Reports form the basis for internal and external audits and are essential for maintaining or renewing certifications.

For environmental standards, reports also serve as tools of **transparency and communication**, showing results in sustainability, resource efficiency and impact reduction.

### Why they matter

- **Build trust**: clients and partners know the organization follows globally recognized standards.  
- **Simplify audits**: structured data collection and consistent process validation.  
- **Facilitate market access**: ISO certification is often mandatory in tenders and contracts.  
- **Support sustainability**: continuous improvement and risk reduction.

### Coming soon in P7CO®

P7CO® EcoResupply will soon provide modules to support ISO certifications and reports. These features will allow organizations to:

- Record and organize compliance evidence.  
- Automate environmental and social performance indicators.  
- Generate annual or periodic reports ready for audits.  
- Connect with existing system data (MIRR, e-GAR, Circularity, ESG).  

This will reduce time and effort while increasing data reliability and transparency.
