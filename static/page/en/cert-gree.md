# ISO Certifications and Reports

The **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** defines globally recognized standards for quality, environment, safety and social responsibility. They provide a common framework that helps organizations demonstrate best practices, ensure compliance and build trust with clients, partners and authorities.

P7CO® EcoResupply acknowledges the importance of these standards and is preparing new features to support companies and municipalities in managing their ISO certifications and reports. Soon, tools for data collection, report generation and digital audit integration will be available.

# What are ISO certifications

ISO certifications are official attestations, issued by accredited bodies, confirming that an organization complies with the requirements of a given standard. Some of the most relevant in management and environment include:

- **ISO 9001 — Quality Management**  
- **ISO 14001 — Environmental Management**  
- **ISO 45001 — Occupational Health and Safety**  
- **ISO 50001 — Energy Management**  
- **ISO 26000 — Social Responsibility**

These standards improve internal processes, ensure consistency and strengthen organizational credibility worldwide.

# What are ISO reports

ISO reports are documents organizations produce to demonstrate compliance with standards. They include policies, procedures, indicators and monitoring evidence. Reports are central to internal and external audits and are essential to maintain or renew certifications.

For environmental standards, reports are also tools of **transparency and communication**, demonstrating sustainability efforts, resource efficiency and impact reduction.

# Why they matter

- **Build trust** with clients and partners through global recognition.  
- **Streamline audits** by structuring data and validating processes.  
- **Facilitate market access** as many public tenders and contracts require ISO certification.  
- **Support sustainability** by promoting continuous improvement and risk reduction.

# Coming soon in P7CO®

P7CO® EcoResupply will soon provide modules to support ISO certifications and reports. These features will enable organizations to:

- Record and organize compliance evidence.  
- Automate environmental and social performance indicators.  
- Generate annual or periodic reports ready for audits.  
- Connect with existing system data (MIRR, e-GAR, circularity, ESG).  

These innovations will reduce the time and effort associated with ISO certifications while improving data reliability and transparency.
