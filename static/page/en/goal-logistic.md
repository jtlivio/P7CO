## What is at stake
Without logistics operators and recyclers, the circular economy cannot function.  
They ensure that company and municipal surpluses are **transported, treated and reintroduced into the production cycle**.  
In the EU, regulatory pressure and operational costs demand **more transparent, digital and collaborative solutions**.

## The problem
- **High transport and treatment costs**: extra kilometres and inefficiencies increase emissions and expenses.  
- **Lack of traceability**: many logistics chains cannot provide digital proof of final destination, making MIRR and EU compliance difficult.  
- **Underutilized capacity**: trucks and containers travel empty due to lack of route-sharing platforms.  
- **Fragmented systems**: logistics ERPs and recycling platforms are not integrated with compliance obligations.  

## The solution: P7CO® EcoResupply
- **Operators Map**  
  Locate transport companies, recyclers and selective collection points across Europe.  

- **Digital Traceability**  
  Generate digital proof of transport and recycling, aligned with **MIRR** and EU directives.  

- **Route Optimization & Capacity Sharing**  
  Algorithms that reduce travelled kilometres and connect companies with transporters with spare capacity.  

- **ERP & API Integration**  
  Connectors to synchronize P7CO® with logistics systems, waste management platforms and environmental reporting.  

- **Environmental Complaints Management**  
  A channel for operators and citizens to report illegal transport, clandestine dumping or poor recycling practices.  

## Why it matters for sustainability
- Reduces emissions and operational costs.  
- Builds trust with customers and regulators.  
- Prevents fines for non-compliance with EU directives.  
- Provides evidence for ESG and compliance reporting.  
- Improves efficiency in the EU circular chain.  

## European example
A logistics company in France integrates P7CO® EcoResupply to optimize its industrial waste transport routes.  
The system generates automatic digital proof for environmental audits.  
Result: **lower costs, compliance with regulations and new business opportunities**.  

## Next steps
1. **Register your company or operator** on P7CO® EcoResupply.  
2. **Publish available logistics capacity** to share.  
3. **Integrate your ERP** to generate digital proof and automatic reports.  
4. **Engage in circular projects** with companies and municipalities across the EU.
