## Who We Are
**P7CO® EcoResupply**, created in Portugal by **pH7x Systems®**, was born to answer an urgent need: **greater transparency in the management of surplus, waste, and environmental complaints**.  

We live in an age where **data is power**. Hidden data weakens society; open and reliable data empowers everyone — citizens, businesses, and governments. P7CO® EcoResupply exists to guarantee that access.

### Our Mission
Our mission is clear:  
- **Give visibility to surplus** that can be reused instead of wasted.  
- **Provide transparent data** that any citizen, public entity, or company can consult.  
- **Turn individual contributions** — such as environmental complaints — into **validated, actionable information** for society.  

We want **every action, every record, every report** to become open data that **builds trust, accelerates collaboration, and creates measurable positive impact**.

### Our Vision
To be the **trusted international platform for environmental data**, inspiring governments, companies, and citizens to **act together**.  
A digital ecosystem where:  
- information is open,  
- circularity is tracked in real time,  
- and citizenship translates into **active and responsible participation**.  

We believe that **transparency is the foundation of sustainability**. Without clear data, there can be no fair circular economy nor healthy environmental democracy.

### Our Values
- **Transparency** — all data, metrics, and reports are auditable.  
- **Citizenship** — every user has the power to participate, report, and monitor.  
- **Sustainability** — every data-driven decision prevents waste and reduces impact.  
- **Innovation** — modular and accessible technology to integrate ERPs, municipal APIs, and citizen apps.  
- **Responsibility** — strict compliance with legal, ethical, and environmental standards.  

### Our Team
Our team brings together **software engineering, data science, environmental management, and logistics expertise**.  
We work alongside **municipalities, universities, NGOs, and private companies** to ensure that P7CO® EcoResupply is not just a digital platform, but a **trusted social infrastructure**.

### Our Impact
The impact of P7CO® is measured in **data, not promises**:  
- **Registered and reused surplus**: tons of materials diverted from waste.  
- **CO₂ avoided**: equivalent to thousands of trees planted.  
- **Environmental complaints**: transformed into validated information forwarded to authorities.  
- **Integrated municipalities**: with open dashboards and real-time reporting.  
- **Active citizens**: empowered to act and monitor through P7CO®.
