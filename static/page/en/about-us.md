## About Us

**P7CO® EcoResupply** is a **Portuguese platform for circularity and by-product valorisation**, created by **pH7x Systems®**.  
It transforms **industrial surpluses, reusable materials, and environmental data** into **economic value and measurable sustainability impact**.  
We believe that **the future of sustainability depends on the intelligent sharing of resources** — and that what is considered waste today can become **tomorrow’s raw material**.

### Who We Are
P7CO® was founded to meet a clear need: **connecting those who have surpluses with those who can use them**, reducing waste and promoting circular economy practices nationwide.  
We combine **data, technology, and collaboration** to build a **reuse ecosystem** where **companies of all sizes**, **municipalities**, and **citizens** can manage and recover resources safely, legally, and transparently.  

Our purpose is simple yet ambitious: to **accelerate the transition towards a real circular economy**, built on open data, trust, and cooperation — **from small producers to large industries**.

### Our Mission
Our mission goes far beyond simply giving by-products a destination.  
**P7CO® EcoResupply** exists to **transform the way Portugal manages, values, and communicates its environmental resources**, fostering a **new culture of transparency, circularity, and shared responsibility**.  

We aim to:
- **Give visibility and purpose to by-products** — whether production leftovers, packaging, equipment, construction materials, or agricultural surpluses — so they can be **reused, recycled, or reintroduced** into new production cycles, **avoiding landfills and reducing emissions**.  
- **Build collaborative networks** among businesses, municipalities, universities, and citizens, enabling the exchange of knowledge, surpluses, and reuse opportunities.  
- **Digitalise environmental compliance**, making legal obligations simpler, faster, and verifiable through data and technology.  
- **Generate measurable positive impact**, tracking not only what is saved but also what is transformed: CO₂ avoided, materials recovered, emissions reduced, and communities engaged.  
- **Educate for sustainability**, encouraging every user — from a small enterprise to a public authority or individual citizen — to become an active part of a fairer, more circular, and regenerative economy.

P7CO® is more than a platform:  
it is a **digital infrastructure for environmental action**, connecting **data, people, and decisions** to create a **sustainable, intelligent, and collaborative ecosystem**.

### Our Vision
To become the **leading platform in Portugal and the European Union** for **by-product valorisation and industrial surplus management**, fostering an economy that is **efficient, collaborative, and regenerative**.  
We envision a future where:
- Companies share data and resources in real time;  
- Municipalities have access to **local circularity indicators**;  
- And citizens actively contribute to **waste reduction and lower emissions**.

We believe that **transparency is the foundation of sustainability** — without clear data, there can be no fair circular economy nor a healthy environmental democracy.

### Our Values
- **Transparency** – all data and exchanges are auditable and traceable.  
- **Circularity** – every by-product holds potential for reuse.  
- **Sustainability** – reducing, reusing, and regenerating come first.  
- **Innovation** – technology serving environmental efficiency.  
- **Collaboration** – linking businesses, municipalities, and communities.  

### What We Do
**P7CO® EcoResupply** acts as a **bridge between those who have surpluses and those who need them**, offering:
- **Interactive maps of by-products and available resources**;  
- **Digital registration and traceability of surpluses**;  
- **Impact reports and reuse performance metrics**;  
- **Integration with public and private environmental management systems**;  
- **Compliance modules (MIRR, e-GAR, LER)** ensuring full legal conformity.

A **by-product**, in the context of the **European Waste Catalogue (LER)**, is a **material generated from a production process** that, while not its main objective, **can be reused safely and lawfully in another economic cycle**, avoiding classification as waste.  
In practice, it is **what ceases to be waste because it gains new purpose** — such as metal shavings returned to smelting, agricultural residues used as biomass, or wood recovered for construction.  
Learn more about the **European Waste Catalogue (LER)** and its classification criteria in [What is the LER and why it matters](/en/blog/detalhe/c-ler).

### Join Us
If you are a **business**, share your **surpluses or by-products** and connect with partners to reuse them.
