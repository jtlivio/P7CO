## Reports and Marketplace by European Zones

P7CO® EcoResupply adopts a regional division of the European Union to organise environmental reports and marketplace surpluses.  
This model enables **comparisons between countries** and alignment with **official sources** (Eurostat, European Commission).

Includes: **Portugal (PT), Spain (ES), Italy (IT), Greece (GR), Malta (MT), Cyprus (CY)**.

### Central / East
Emerging economies with rapid progress in circularity.  
Includes: **Poland (PL), Hungary (HU), Czechia (CZ), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), Croatia (HR), Bulgaria (BG), Romania (RO)**.

### Islands / Atlantic
