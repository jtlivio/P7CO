## Environmental Reports and Surpluses by EU Zones

**P7COÂ® EcoResupply** applies a regional division of the **European Union (EU27)** to structure **environmental reports** (illegal dumping, pollution, regulatory breaches) and **surpluses** (reusable materials, valuable waste, end-of-life products).  
This model improves **comparability across countries**, ensures **statistical consistency**, and supports **Eurostat and EU reporting**.

## Defined Zones

### Northern Zone
**Profile:** High recycling rates, active civic participation, advanced environmental policies.  
- **Reports:** marine pollution, cross-border waste transport, forestry issues.  
- **Surpluses:** wood, plastics, recyclable metals.  
- **Countries:**  
  - ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Sweden (SE)  
  - ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° Denmark (DK)  
  - ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® Finland (FI)  
  - ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡ª Estonia (EE)  
  - ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡» Latvia (LV)  
  - ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡¹ Lithuania (LT)  

### Western Zone
**Profile:** Highly industrialized economies with strong innovation and large volumes of technological waste.  
- **Reports:** industrial emissions, air pollution, non-compliance with regulations.  
- **Surpluses:** chemicals, machinery, electronics.  
- **Countries:**  
  - ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª Germany (DE)  
  - ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· France (FR)  
  - ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ Austria (AT)  
  - ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª Belgium (BE)  
  - ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡º Luxembourg (LU)  
  - ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± Netherlands (NL)  

### Southern Zone
**Profile:** Mediterranean region with strong agriculture and seasonal tourism pressure.  
- **Reports:** poorly managed urban waste, coastal pollution, illegal landfills.  
- **Surpluses:** food, agricultural residues, construction materials.  
- **Countries:**  
  - ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹ Portugal (PT)  
  - ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spain (ES)  
  - ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italy (IT)  
  - ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· Greece (GR)  
  - ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¹ Malta (MT)  
  - ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¾ Cyprus (CY)  

### Central-Eastern Zone
**Profile:** Transition economies with rapidly growing circularity policies.  
- **Reports:** illegal discharges, water pollution, weak enforcement.  
- **Surpluses:** textiles, untreated plastics, scrap metal.  
- **Countries:**  
  - ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± Poland (PL)  
  - ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º Hungary (HU)  
  - ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ Czechia (CZ)  
  - ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡° Slovakia (SK)  
  - ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡® Slovenia (SI)  
  - ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡· Croatia (HR)  
  - ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬ Bulgaria (BG)  
  - ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ Romania (RO)  

### Insular / Atlantic Zone
**Profile:** Island regions with logistical challenges and focus on self-sufficiency.  
- **Reports:** illegal waste exports, coastal pollution.  
- **Surpluses:** agricultural and technological residues.  
- **Countries:**  
  - ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª Ireland (IE)  

## Benefits of the Classification

- **Regional comparison:** detect trends in reports and surpluses.  
- **Statistical alignment:** compatible with Eurostat methodologies.  
- **Strategic planning:** support for governments, municipalities, and businesses.  
- **Transparency:** data accessible to citizens, companies, and institutions.  

## Next Steps

P7COÂ® EcoResupply will:  
- Provide **interactive maps** linking reports and surplus flows.  
- Publish **regional comparison reports** for the EU27.  
- Develop **dashboards** for citizens, companies, and policymakers.  
- Issue **digital certificates** of circularity per zone.
