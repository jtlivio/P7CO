## Under Study
At **P7CO® EcoResupply**, we believe a mobile app can bring citizens, companies, and municipalities even closer to circularity.  
But we don’t want to design this solution alone — we want to listen to those who will actually use it.  

The app is in an **exploratory and co-creation phase**, which is why we are opening the process to **feedback, suggestions, and community contributions**.

## App Goals
- **Facilitate environmental reporting** with photos and geolocation.  
- **Simplify surplus publication** directly from your phone.  
- **Provide real-time impact metrics** (CO₂ saved, reuse, ESG reports).  
- **Send notifications** about submissions, pickups, and results.  

## What’s Still Being Discussed
- Interface design adapted to different user profiles.  
- Offline features for areas with low network coverage.  
- Integration levels with municipal portals and open APIs.  
- Enhanced privacy and security policies to protect personal data.  

## How You Can Help
We are gathering input from the community:  
- **Citizens**: what features would make participation easier?  
- **Companies**: what data do you need to manage daily?  
- **Municipalities**: what integrations would you like to see?  

Share your ideas, suggestions, and priorities.  
Together, we can build a **practical, trustworthy, and impactful app**.  

**pH7x Systems® — Balance is our formula.**  
Co-created with the community, powered by **P7CO® EcoResupply**.
