## What is Featured Content

In P7CO® EcoResupply, “featured content” refers to items that are given extra visibility on the platform because they provide added value to the community.  
This may include:

- **Relevant surpluses** in the marketplace.  
- **Strategic partners** with proven positive impact.  
- **Success stories** worth sharing as examples.  
- **Editorial articles and content** useful for companies and citizens.  

We do not accept or promote hazardous waste or prohibited content.  
We only highlight materials, partners and practices aligned with **circularity, trust and sustainability**.

## How We Select

Selection is based on:

- **Relevance** to the circular economy and the community.  
- **Positive impact** – social, environmental or economic.  
- **Transparency**: users clearly understand what is featured and why.  
- **Trusted partnerships**, verified and aligned with P7CO® values.

## Transparency Best Practices

- All featured content is clearly identified.  
- No “hidden advertising” – users know if they are viewing surpluses, partners or editorial content.  
- Featuring does not mean certification or endorsement – only higher visibility.  
- Formal partnerships or collaborations are indicated openly.

## Why It Matters

Featuring is a way to recognize value, share good practices and make it easier for the community to access what is most relevant.  
At the same time, it strengthens trust: users know the criteria are objective and clear.

## Conclusion

At P7CO® EcoResupply, featuring is about valuing those who contribute to circularity and guiding the community toward inspiring examples.  
We do this with **transparency, simplicity and ethics**.
