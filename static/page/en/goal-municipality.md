## What’s at stake
Municipalities are responsible for **critical public services** such as waste management, water supply, urban mobility, and land use planning.  
The **European Green Deal** and national circular economy plans require local authorities to **cut emissions, increase recycling, and improve transparency in environmental management**.  

## The problem
- **Rising costs of urban waste**: high expenses for collection, transport, and landfill.  
- **Surpluses and wasted resources**: public equipment, construction materials, and food surpluses not reused.  
- **Local environmental complaints**: illegal discharges, burning, and air pollution undermine public trust.  
- **Mandatory reporting**: MIRR, EU directives, and national plans demand structured environmental data.  
- **Fragmented systems**: municipal ERPs, waste platforms, and environmental databases don’t communicate.  

## The solution: P7CO® EcoResupply
P7CO® EcoResupply offers an integrated platform for municipalities:

- **Circular Municipal Map**  
  Identifies surpluses, selective collection points, licensed operators, and reuse projects.  

- **Environmental Complaints Management**  
  Citizen interface to submit complaints, automatically routed to the competent services.  

- **Compliance & Reporting**  
  Tools to simplify mandatory reports (MIRR, ESG, local indicators) aligned with EU standards.  

- **ERP & API Integration**  
  Connectors linking P7CO® EcoResupply with municipal systems:  
  - **Municipal ERP** (e.g., SAP, PHC, Primavera) to integrate financial and environmental data.  
  - **Open APIs** to share environmental indicators with citizens, regulators, and the EU.  
  - **Process automation**: automatic import of waste collection or energy consumption data.  

- **Community Engagement**  
  Citizens and associations can propose reuse projects, share best practices, and monitor real-time indicators.  

## Why it matters for sustainability
- Cuts operational and administrative costs.  
- Builds public trust through transparency.  
- Produces environmental reports **without duplicated effort**.  
- Increases local recycling and reuse rates.  
- Contributes to the EU’s carbon neutrality target by 2050.  

## European example
A municipality in Lisbon faces audits on urban waste management.  
P7CO® EcoResupply connects to the municipal ERP and generates automatic reports for the environmental agency.  
Result: **legal compliance, administrative efficiency, and greater public trust**.  

## Next steps
1. **Register your municipality** in P7CO® EcoResupply.  
2. **Enable ERP integration** to automate financial and environmental data.  
3. **Publish surpluses and resources** for local reuse.  
4. **Report transparently** in EU-compatible formats.
