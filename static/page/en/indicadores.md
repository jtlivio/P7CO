## Impact Indicators at P7CO®

At P7CO® EcoResupply we believe sustainability must be measurable.  
Our impact indicators show, in a clear and transparent way, the value created by the platform in three main dimensions:

- **Environmental**  
- **Social**  
- **Economic**  

Each indicator is based on real data from surpluses, partnerships and activities registered on the platform.

## Environmental

Measuring the positive environmental benefits of circularity:

- **Tons of waste diverted from landfill**  
- **CO₂ emissions avoided** through reuse instead of new production  
- **Water and energy saved**, based on average production factors  

## Social

Assessing contributions to local communities and users:

- **Associations and NGOs supported**  
- **Circularity events and initiatives promoted**  
- **Indirect volunteering**, with citizens involved in collection and reuse  

## Economic

Measuring financial value for companies and partners:

- **Estimated value of reused surpluses**  
- **Costs avoided** in waste disposal and logistics  
- **Indirect revenue created** through circular opportunities  

## How We Calculate

- Use of **internationally recognized average factors**  
- Direct link to **data entered on the platform**  
- **Transparency**: every indicator can be audited from records  
- **Regular review and calibration** to ensure reliability  

## Why It Matters

- **For companies**: demonstrate sustainable impact in ESG reports and tenders  
- **For municipalities**: report local circular economy results  
- **For the community**: understand the benefits of reuse in simple terms  

## Next Steps

Soon, P7CO® EcoResupply will offer:

- Real-time dashboards with indicators  
- Exportable reports for certifications and audits  
- Direct integration with **MIRR, e-GAR and ISO reporting**
