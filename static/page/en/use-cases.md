# P7CO® Success Stories

The P7CO® EcoResupply platform only makes sense as a network.  
Here we highlight two success stories with national partners.

## Maré Alta — Circularity in the Nautical Sector

**Sector:** Blue Economy / Nautical

Maré Alta is a strategic partner in the nautical sector, responsible for collecting, reusing and making available surplus materials related to boats, shipyards and port activities.

- **Reuse of materials:** wood, ropes, nautical equipment  
- **Environmental impact:** less waste in landfills, more local reuse  
- **Social benefits:** involvement of local associations and sailing schools in collection and reuse  

> _"With P7CO®, we managed to give a second life to materials that were previously wasted."_

## Sibertex — Efficiency in Storage and Parking

**Sector:** Logistics / Storage
