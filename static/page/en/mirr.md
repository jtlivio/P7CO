# MIRR and e-GAR: Obligations, Deadlines and Importance

Waste management in Portugal relies on two central digital instruments: the **Integrated Waste Register (MIRR)** and the **Electronic Waste Transport Document (e-GAR)**. Both are managed in **SILiAmb** (Integrated Environmental Licensing System) under the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) and are designed to ensure traceability, transparency and compliance with national and European environmental goals. Soon P7CO® EcoResupply will introduce new features in this area, including integration with **SINLAB** and automatic deadline alerts.

# What is MIRR

The MIRR is a mandatory annual declaration where waste producers, carriers and operators report the quantity and type of waste generated, transported or treated. It includes hazardous and non-hazardous waste, depending on the company’s activity and size. This register is essential for APA and the European Commission to monitor waste management in Portugal and assess progress towards circular economy goals.

Entities obliged to submit MIRR include producers of hazardous waste, as well as those producing non-hazardous waste if they exceed certain thresholds. Licensed waste operators, carriers and intermediaries are also required to submit.

# What is e-GAR

The e-GAR is the electronic document that accompanies waste from its origin to its final destination. It is completed in SILiAmb and contains information about the producer, carrier, vehicle, recipient, and the type and quantity of waste. This digital system replaced the old paper-based forms, making the process of transporting waste faster, traceable and auditable.

All parties — producer, carrier and recipient — have responsibilities in filling out and validating the e-GAR. The document must accompany the waste during the entire transport process, even in digital format, and remains available in the system for five years.

# Deadlines and Obligations

The MIRR must be submitted each year by **31 March**, covering the previous calendar year. For example, the MIRR for 2025 must be submitted by 31 March 2026 at the latest. This deadline is legally binding, and failure to comply constitutes an environmental offence.

The e-GAR does not have a fixed annual deadline: it must be issued whenever a waste transport subject to mandatory accompaniment occurs. Each journey involving hazardous waste, or certain types of non-hazardous waste, must be accompanied by a valid and confirmed e-GAR.

# Importance of Compliance

Complying with MIRR and e-GAR obligations is essential to remain legally compliant and avoid fines. However, their importance goes beyond legal compliance. These systems ensure transparency in waste management, provide traceability of producer, carrier and recipient, and help reduce environmental, social and reputational risks.

Strategically, MIRR and e-GAR data feed into national and EU reports, guide public policy, and enable Portugal to report circular economy indicators to the European Union. Without this reliable data, it would be impossible to achieve targets such as reducing landfill disposal or increasing recycling rates.

# Consequences of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance can result in significant fines, classified as serious or very serious environmental offences depending on the type of waste and the severity of the infringement. Beyond financial impact, there is a risk of reputational damage and difficulty in securing contracts that require proof of environmental compliance.

# Upcoming Features

P7CO® EcoResupply is preparing integrations with **SINLAB** and developing automatic alerts and deadline management for MIRR and e-GAR. These features will simplify company compliance, ensure deadlines are not missed, and keep records secure and auditable. Soon we will share updates on how users will be able to benefit from intelligent notifications and integrated reports directly within the platform.
