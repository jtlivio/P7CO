## Official and ESG Indicators

P7CO® EcoResupply measures impact with **official indicators**, complemented by internationally recognized **ESG metrics**.  
We combine platform data (surpluses, partnerships, reuse) with national and European frameworks.

## Environmental Indicators

- **Tons of waste diverted from landfill** (APA, Eurostat – *env_wasmun*)  
- **CO₂ emissions avoided** (EEA average factors)  
- **Water and energy saved** (UNEP – resource efficiency indicators)  
- **Recycling and circularity rates** (EU 2035 targets: ≥65% recycling, ≤10% landfill)  

## Social Indicators

- **Number of associations / NGOs supported**  
- **Number of community circularity initiatives**  
- **Direct and indirect beneficiaries**  
- **Citizen participation in volunteering**  

## Economic Indicators

- **Estimated value of reused surpluses** (average market price)  
- **Waste disposal costs avoided** (official fee benchmarks)  
- **Logistics and operational savings**  
- **Indirect revenue created through circular opportunities**  

## Governance Indicators

- **Privacy and consent adoption rates**  
- **Transparency in partnerships and featured content**  
- **Data traceability and auditability**  
- **Compliance with EU and national regulations (GDPR, DSA)**  

## ESG Alignment

- **E (Environmental)** — waste, CO₂, water, energy  
- **S (Social)** — community, inclusion, beneficiaries  
- **G (Governance)** — transparency, privacy, compliance
