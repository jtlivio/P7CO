## Our Mission
The mission of **P7CO® EcoResupply** is to **transform surpluses and environmental complaints into transparent, accessible and useful data**, creating positive impact for businesses, municipalities and citizens.  

We aim to:  
- **Prevent waste** and give resources a second life through reuse, donation and recovery.  
- **Empower citizenship** with digital tools to participate, report and track results in real time.  
- **Support companies and municipalities** with clear metrics, impact certification and reliable ESG reporting.  
- **Ensure environmental compliance** through auditable digital processes aligned with national and European legislation.  

Every record, every report and every action within the platform contributes to a **more balanced, fair and sustainable ecosystem**.

## Our Vision
The vision of **P7CO® EcoResupply** is to become the **international trusted platform for environmental and circular data**, inspiring governments, companies and citizens to act together.  

We envision a future where:  
- **Data is open and verifiable**, ensuring trust and transparency.  
- **The circular economy becomes daily practice**, not just a policy concept.  
- **Every citizen actively participates** in protecting the environment and reducing waste.  
- **Organizations communicate impact clearly**, strengthening their social and environmental responsibility.  
- **Cities become smart and regenerative**, with policies based on real and collaborative data.  

## What Guides Us
- **Transparency**: without clear data there is no credible sustainability.  
- **Collaboration**: only together — citizens, businesses and municipalities — can we change the paradigm.  
- **Innovation**: modular technology integrating ERP, APIs and real-time reporting.  
- **Responsibility**: always acting in legal, ethical and environmental compliance.  
- **Measurable impact**: because what cannot be measured cannot be transformed.
