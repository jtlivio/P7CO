## What is at stake
European companies are at the center of the transition towards a **circular and climate-neutral economy by 2050**.  
The **European Green Deal**, the **EU Circular Economy Strategy**, and regulations such as **CSRD** and the **EU Taxonomy Regulation** create new obligations for reporting, traceability, and resource reuse.  
This is not just about compliance, but about **ensuring competitiveness in the European Single Market**.

## The problem
- **Surpluses without circular use**: tons of valuable materials are wasted every year.  
- **Environmental and financial costs**: waste means expenses and the risk of penalties from the EU and national authorities.  
- **Strict regulation**: MIRR, E-PRTR, CSRD, ISO, EU Taxonomy, and waste directives demand detailed reports and documented evidence.  
- **Rising environmental complaints**: citizens, NGOs, and regulators expose failures, damaging reputation and potentially triggering legal action.  

## The solution: P7CO® EcoResupply
**P7CO® EcoResupply** is the European answer to turn risks into opportunities:

- **Circular Marketplace**  
  Companies can publish surpluses and find buyers or recyclers across the European Union.  

- **European Compliance**  
  Tools adapted to CSRD, EU Taxonomy, ISO, and ESG reporting, aligned with European Commission requirements.  

- **Indicators & Metrics**  
  Dashboards translate positive impact into numbers: CO₂ avoided, resources saved, and contributions to the SDGs.  

- **Environmental Complaints Management**  
  Transparency in handling reports of pollution, bad practices, or illegal discharges, integrated into ESG communication and audits.  

## Why it matters for sustainability
Adopting EU-aligned circular practices means:  
- Meeting mandatory regulations and avoiding fines.  
- Increasing investor and consumer confidence.  
- Reducing dependence on imported raw materials.  
- Contributing to climate neutrality by 2050.  

## European example
A chemical company in Germany faces complaints of illegal discharges.  
On P7CO® EcoResupply, it can register the incident, demonstrate corrective measures, and communicate results in a **CSRD-compliant** format.  
The outcome: **legal compliance, reputation preserved, and access to green financing**.

## Next steps
1. **Register your company** on P7CO® EcoResupply.  
2. **Publish surpluses** and connect with circular partners in Portugal and across the EU.  
3. **Integrate EU compliance** into your ESG and environmental reports.  
4. **Show transparency** in audits and complaints handling.
