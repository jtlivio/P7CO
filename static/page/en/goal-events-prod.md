## What is at stake
Every year, the European Union, Member States, municipalities, universities, and NGOs promote **programs and events dedicated to circularity, innovation, and sustainability**.  
These spaces for exchange are crucial to create partnerships, accelerate projects, and scale solutions that respond to the **European Green Deal** and the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.  

## The problem
- **Dispersed initiatives**: EU, national, and local programs are not always visible to companies and citizens.  
- **Lack of coordination**: funding opportunities, trainings, and conferences lose impact without a shared agenda.  
- **Low participation**: many organizations are unaware of support mechanisms or relevant events for their sector.  

## The solution: P7CO® EcoResupply
**P7CO® EcoResupply** serves as a **collaborative hub for programs and events**, highlighting what already exists and giving it greater visibility:

- **Integrated Calendar**  
  Brings together conferences, workshops, fairs, and support programs in Portugal and across the EU.  

- **Visibility for Local Initiatives**  
  Municipalities, companies, and associations can share their own initiatives and engage more participants.  

- **Connection with Funding**  
  Links events to European funding programs (PRR, Horizon Europe, LIFE, etc.), helping ideas become concrete projects.  

- **Active Community**  
  A space to share experiences, best practices, and results of past events.  

## Why it matters for sustainability
- Boosts participation and cross-sector cooperation.  
- Increases the success rate of circular projects.  
- Avoids duplication of efforts and fosters resource sharing.  
- Scales local solutions to the European level.  

## Examples
- European Conference on **Circular Economy and Innovation**.  
- Municipal **environmental education programs** with schools and associations.  
- **Green technology fairs** connecting startups, researchers, and investors.  

## Next steps
1. **Check the calendar** of programs and events on P7CO® EcoResupply.  
2. **Share your initiatives** to engage the community.  
3. **Explore cooperation and funding opportunities**.  
4. **Participate actively** in local, national, and European events.
