# P7CO EcoResupply Privacy Policy

## 1. Who we are
P7CO EcoResupply is a brand operated by pH7x Systems JOAO P.S.V.T. LIVIO.  
Tax ID 198690851  
Registered office Rua Pulido Valente, 24 RC DTO, 2910-642 Setúbal, Portugal  
Privacy contact [privacy@ph7x.com](mailto:privacy@ph7x.com)  
DPO contact (if applicable) [abuse@p7co.org](mailto:abuse@p7co.org)

This Policy applies to P7CO EcoResupply websites, applications, and support channels targeted at the European Union and the European Economic Area. The main legal framework is the [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj), complemented in Portugal by [Law No. 58/2019](https://dre.pt/dre/detalhe/lei/58-2019-123815253), [Law No. 41/2004](https://dre.pt/dre/detalhe/lei/41-2004-568010) (electronic communications and cookies), and [Law No. 93/2021](https://dre.pt/dre/detalhe/lei/93-2021-172445027) (whistleblower protection). For intermediary services and due diligence, the [Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 — DSA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj) applies where relevant.

The lead supervisory authority is the [CNPD — Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados](https://www.cnpd.pt) in Portugal (GDPR [one-stop-shop mechanism](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/consistency-findings/one-stop-shop-mechanism_en)). Users may also file complaints with their local supervisory authority in the EEA.

## 2. Purposes and legal bases
We process personal data for specific and legitimate purposes. Below are representative examples.

| Transactions | messages, proposals, files, records | enabling surplus and reuse offers, service performance | contract performance (6/1-b) |
| Support | requests, attachments, optional recordings | assistance, evidence, process improvement | legitimate interest (6/1-f) |

Special categories of data (GDPR Art. 9) are not requested. If provided by the user (e.g., in reports), they will only be processed when strictly necessary, with an appropriate legal basis (e.g., exercise of legal rights) and enhanced safeguards.

## 3. Children and digital consent ages
When processing depends on a minor’s consent for information society services, the minimum age is set by the law of their country of residence.

| Italy | 14 |

If the child is below the minimum age, verifiable parental consent is required (GDPR Art. 8).
