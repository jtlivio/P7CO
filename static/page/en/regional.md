## Regional Statistics by Country

Circular economy must be based on **reliable data**.  
P7CO® EcoResupply will publish **regional statistics by country**, combining:

- **Official sources** (Eurostat, national statistics, environmental agencies)  
- **Platform data** (environmental reports, surpluses, reuse records)  

These statistics will be released soon, ensuring **transparency** and **practical value**.

## Key Indicators

### Environmental Reports
- Number of reports per region  
- Most common categories (waste, noise, illegal discharges, air pollution)  
- Trends over time (monthly/annual)

### Surpluses and Marketplace
- Volume of surpluses registered per region  
- Most common categories (wood, metals, textiles, plastics)  
- Reuse rate compared to availability

### Environmental Impact
- Tons of waste diverted from landfill  
- CO₂ emissions avoided  
- Water and energy saved

### Economic & Social
- Estimated value of reused surpluses  
- Waste management costs avoided  
- Organisations and citizens directly benefiting

## Regional Structure

Data will be presented in multiple levels:

- **By country** (e.g. Portugal, Spain, Germany)  
- **By official NUTS-II regions** (Norte, Centro, Lisboa, Alentejo, Algarve, Açores, Madeira)  
- **By European zones** (North, West, South, Central/East, Islands)

## Why It Matters

- **Companies**: support ESG and sustainability reporting  
- **Municipalities**: track circular economy performance locally  
- **Citizens**: understand the scale of environmental reports and reuse  

## Coming Soon

Statistics will soon be available via **interactive maps** and **downloadable reports** within P7CO® EcoResupply.
