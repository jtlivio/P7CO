## What’s at stake
NGOs and universities are often the **first line of environmental defense** and the **main centers of social and scientific innovation**.  
With the climate and circular transition underway, these actors must **join forces with companies and municipalities** to influence policies, train citizens and generate validated knowledge.

## The problem
- **Lack of accessible data**: reports and environmental information are scattered and not always open.  
- **Environmental complaints without follow-up**: citizens report pollution or illegal discharges, but often with no structured response.  
- **Limited funding**: research projects and awareness campaigns compete for scarce resources.  
- **Fragmented knowledge**: researchers, NGOs and municipalities work in silos, missing collaboration opportunities.  

## The solution: P7CO® EcoResupply
P7CO® EcoResupply bridges civil society, science and the public sector:

- **Environmental Complaints Platform**  
  Citizens and NGOs can report incidents (pollution, illegal discharges, deforestation), routed to competent authorities.  

- **Open Science & Shared Data**  
  Repository of surpluses, environmental indicators and anonymized complaints available in open formats for academic and journalistic use.  

- **Partnerships for Applied Research**  
  Universities can use platform data for theses, papers and innovation projects in partnership with NGOs and municipalities.  

- **Community Engagement**  
  Citizen participation tools involving schools, local associations and volunteers in circular economy and zero-waste initiatives.  

- **SDGs & Compliance**  
  Indicators aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and European reporting frameworks.  

## Why it matters for sustainability
- Gives **citizens a voice** through actionable complaints.  
- Allows NGOs and universities to **validate real-time data**.  
- Increases **transparency and public trust**.  
- Promotes **participatory environmental education**.  
- Connects civil society to the **EU’s 2050 carbon neutrality goals**.  

## European example
An environmental NGO in Spain uses P7CO® EcoResupply to collect complaints about river pollution.  
➡ The data is integrated into academic reports by a partner university and presented to the European Commission.  
Result: **reinforced local policies, funded projects and greater visibility for environmental causes**.  

## Next steps
1. **Register your NGO or academic institution** on P7CO® EcoResupply.  
2. **Use platform data** for campaigns, reports and research.  
3. **Mobilize volunteers and citizens** to report environmental incidents.  
4. **Share knowledge** and contribute to an open European sustainability ecosystem.
