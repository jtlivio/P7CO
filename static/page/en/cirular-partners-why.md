## Why Circular Partnerships?
The circular economy is not an individual effort: it requires **collaboration among multiple actors**.  
**P7CO® EcoResupply** acts as a **trusted platform**, building bridges between those who **have surpluses** and those who **need resources**, between those who **report issues** and those who **are responsible to act**.  

## How Partnerships Work
- **Companies** make surpluses available and meet ESG goals.  
- **Municipalities** integrate APIs and receive real-time data on waste and environmental reports.  
- **NGOs and citizens** use P7CO® tools to actively participate and ensure transparent impact.  
- **Universities and research centers** collaborate to validate metrics and foster applied innovation.  

## Benefits of the Network
- **Open and transparent data**, auditable by all partners.  
- **Measurable impact**, with digital certification of reuse, avoided CO₂ and social indicators.  
- **Logistical efficiency**, through shared resources and integration with carriers and environmental operators.  
- **Continuous innovation**, driven by cooperation between technology, science and field practice.  

## Examples of Partnerships
- Municipalities with environmental portals integrated into P7CO®.  
- Industrial companies turning surpluses into donations for NGOs and charities.  
- Universities validating waste **matching** algorithms.  
- Logistics operators ensuring sustainable collection and delivery.  

## Our Commitment
More than a technological platform, **P7CO® EcoResupply** is an **infrastructure for circular collaboration**.  
Each partner strengthens the network, increases transparency and ensures that circularity moves from concept to **daily, measurable and reliable practice**.
