## The Operational Cycle
**P7CO® EcoResupply** was designed to be simple, transparent, and collaborative.  
Every interaction — whether publishing surplus materials or reporting an environmental issue — is transformed into **validated, open, and useful data** for society as a whole.

### 1. Registration & Access
- Citizens, companies, and municipalities can register quickly.  
- Secure authentication via email, Google, or social media.  
- Each user has a **personal dashboard** with history, indicators, and reports.

### 2. Publishing Surplus
- Companies and entities register surplus materials, equipment, or waste.  
- Each entry includes description, photos, geolocation, and standardized codes (LER).  
- The system automatically assigns a **potential impact label** (CO₂ avoided, reuse, donation).

### 3. Automatic Matching
- The algorithm matches surplus with entities actively looking for materials.  
- If a match is found, **logistics scheduling is suggested immediately**.  
- If not, the surplus is **shared with the community** to increase reuse opportunities.

### 4. Environmental Complaints
- Citizens can submit environmental complaints with photo, location, and category.  
- The system **validates basic data** and forwards the complaint to the relevant authority.  
- All records remain transparently accessible, ensuring public trust.

### 5. Certification & Reporting
- Each completed transaction generates a **digital impact certificate**.  
- Companies receive metrics for **ESG and annual reports**.  
- Municipalities have **real-time dashboards** to shape evidence-based policies.  
- Citizens can follow **open statistics** and see concrete results.

### 6. Real-Time Results
- **Tons of materials reused**, **CO₂ avoided**, **donations completed**.  
- Public maps and indicators accessible to everyone.  
- Total transparency: data is open, verifiable, and auditable.

## What Sets Us Apart
- **Transparent data**: every record can be consulted and audited.  
- **Active citizenship**: reports and contributions are recognized as real impact.  
- **ERP & municipal API integration**: frictionless, no duplicated effort.  
- **Measurable impact**: everything is converted into clear metrics for ESG and public policies.  

## The Future
P7CO® EcoResupply grows as a network: each new user, company, or municipality makes the platform **more complete, more accurate, and more useful**.  
This is how we create **true circularity**, where **every data point counts and every action drives impact**.
