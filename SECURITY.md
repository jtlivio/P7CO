# Security Policy · P7CO® EcoResupply

This document defines the security practices for the **P7CO® EcoResupply Blog and Content Repository**.

## 🔐 Supported Versions

This repository contains primarily **content** (Markdown blog posts, articles, pages, and images) and a small set of **supporting scripts/helpers**.
Only the latest version of the **`main` branch** is actively maintained and monitored for security concerns.

## 📩 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential vulnerability or security concern:

* **Do not** create a public Issue or Pull Request.
* Instead, report it privately to the security team:

📧 **Email:** [hello@p7co.org](mailto:hello@p7co.org)
🌐 **Website:** [https://p7co.org](https://p7co.org)

When reporting, please include:

* A clear description of the issue.
* Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
* Potential impact and affected files/areas.
* Any suggestions for mitigation.

## ⚡ Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** → We will confirm receipt of your report within **72 hours**.
2. **Investigation** → Our team will analyze the issue and determine severity and impact.
3. **Mitigation** → If confirmed, we will prepare and deploy a fix or provide a recommended mitigation.
4. **Disclosure** → Once resolved, we will notify the reporter and, if appropriate, publish a public advisory

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Contributors

* Do not include secrets, credentials, or personal information in Markdown, commits, or images.
* Follow the repository rules for **GDPR compliance** (authors of blog posts/articles must not insert personal data — profiles are handled via platform metadata).
* Use only vetted dependencies and ensure updates follow security guidelines.
* Respect branch protection and CI linting requirements.
