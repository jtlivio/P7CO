## 🌍 About the Project

**Our Mission**
To promote a real circular economy worldwide by simplifying the reuse of surplus and waste through innovative technology.
We connect companies, public entities, and citizens, making material reuse simple, transparent, and measurable.

**Our Vision**
To become the reference platform for sustainable resource management, inspiring a shift toward a regenerative and collaborative economic model — where every material counts, and every contribution creates positive, measurable impact for society and the planet.

**Circularity**
The future begins with every choice: reuse, share, transform!
P7CO® EcoResupply is the international community that connects companies, citizens, and organizations to give new life to surpluses.
Here, every action matters — contribute to a more circular economy, reduce waste, and inspire real change.
Join us and be part of a new generation of solutions: smarter, more collaborative, and more sustainable.
