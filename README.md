## 📌 Blog Frontmatter Specification (P7CO® EcoResupply)

All articles are written in **Markdown** with structured YAML frontmatter using `+++` delimiters:

Each article must begin with a **frontmatter block** in YAML, delimited by `+++`.  
This metadata controls how the blog content is structured, displayed, and indexed.

### Required fields
- **title** → Main article title (used in headers and listing cards).
- **intro** → Short introduction (used in previews and summaries).
- **image** → Path to the cover image (1200×675 px, ≤150 KB).
- **date** → Publication date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **active** → Controls visibility (`true` or `false`).

### Recommended fields
- **updated_at** → Last updated date (helps with SEO and freshness).
- **category** → Main category of the article (`guides`, `news`, `case-studies`, `esg`, `tech`).
- **tags** → Array of keywords (e.g. `["Sustainability", "Circular Economy"]`).
- **summary** → Extended SEO description for search engines and social previews.
- **slug** → Unique identifier for the URL (defaults to file name but can be overridden).

### Author fields
- **author** → Name of the main author.
- **author_bio** → Short biography or role.
- **author_image_url** → Author’s photo (e.g. `/images/authors/jtlivio.jpg`).

### Optional fields
- **reading_time** → Estimated reading time in minutes.
- **lang** → Language code (`pt`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`).  
  Usually inferred from folder path (`/content/blog/en/`), but can be explicitly set for validation.
